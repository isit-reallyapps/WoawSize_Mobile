# WoawSize-Mobile
WoawSize is a Crypto Trade Size Calculator for CFDs and Futures. Just like every other WoawApp WoawSize is ad-free and has all 
the features you'd expect from a Crypto Trade Size Calculator (and some more to come).

# Installation
1. Download the latest version of the apk using this google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j90zTV2yjH67o0u72XQ0bapLy8YNzRFu/view?usp=sharing).
2. Once the apk has downloaded install it. Note you might get a google play dialog that says "Blocked by Play Protect". This happens because I am
not a registered google playstore developer, click "install anyway" or "more details" and then "install anyway".

 # Usage
 Usage is fairly straight forward:
 1. Insert your total account size
 2. Insert your risk percentage (example: if you risk 2% of your capital per trade insert "2")
 3. Insert multiplier (default is "1" -- 1 means no multiplier)
 4. Insert entry price
 5. Insert stoploss price
 6. Insert takeprofit price
 7. Hit Long or Short depending on your trade
 8. Hit "Copy Position Size" to copy the amount of currency you should use for that trade
    
"Position Size" is the currency amount to use for that trade (example: if position size is 1000 then enter with 1000 dollars,gbp,etc.)
"Asset Amount" is how much of the asset itsel to buy (example: is asset amount is 0.001 then enter with 0.001 BTC, ETH, etc)
